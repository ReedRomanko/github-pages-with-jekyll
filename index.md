I'm glad you're here! As a budding economist, I plan to do a fair bit of writing about a fair number of topics. All of those projects will have a lot of moving parts, be it data sets, scripts for cleaning code, visualizations, and or writings. Those components will be accessible here, and hopefully some finished products too.

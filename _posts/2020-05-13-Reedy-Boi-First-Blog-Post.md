Greetings, friends.

There comes a time in every young persons life when they must face new, exciting dangers, brave the unknown, and learn softwares and
languages foreign to them. The time is now for me. While I tackle github, I will slay SQL, scuffle with Stata, and punch up python.

Thank you for your time.
